# Time-series-modelling-and-analysis-of-gene-expression-data


The main aim of this project is to analyze and to fit a non-linear regression model to the gene expression dataset. The dataset comprises of 5 gene (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) and Time (in mins). The input genes are x4 and x5 and the output gene is x5. The goal of the analysis is to find the best model with the least Mean Squared Error (MSE) from the input genes. We build the candidate input (x4, x5) set X using the given model structure and refer the output gene x3 as ‘y’. 
 

To gain better understanding of the data provided in the problem, we perform exploratory data analysis and then proceed further with the model selection using the forward subset model selection algorithm. Once the best model is identified we validate the model. The uncertainty between the model parameters and predictions are identified. The posterior is estimated using the Approximate Bayesian computation.
